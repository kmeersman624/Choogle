            <h5 className="textPadding">Web Design and Brand Development</h5>
            <h6 className="textPadding">Today's modern methods of branding your business in the digital age have created more challenges for the average brick and mortars. The current world climate has presented even more challenges to get with modern web design, or close the doors. Branding your business in an approachable way will allow you to create an online presence and make your website the face of your company. Ease of use to the end user is key, and with builds consisting of reusable components and helpful tools to create a flow from first getting to the web page to leaving either from the contact, or checkout with a thank you. 
            <br />
            <br />
            As a web creative, i've started really digging into what works for the average user, what makes someone want to come back, again and again. Clean lines, with uncluttered space but well placed call to action, and the consideration of what the customer would like to see. Suggestive advertising for product placement or services in a scrolling concept have been known to be the smarter choice for layout due to people not wanting to have to click around to separate pages unless they seek the additional information after being triggered by one of those well placed call to actions.
            <br />
            <br />
            Do some research, check out some of your favorite brands, see what works for them. What websites do you visit that draw your attention, and take note of what seems to make you dive further into knowing more about the details or information on a company, product based site, or personal page.
