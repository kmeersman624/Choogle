  ## Challenges
  * We had to work through 401 errors from Passport when trying to authenticate the user email and password.  We had used code from a previous project that was using Sequelize instead of Mongoose with Passport.  We needed to go through code and make sure everything was set up to work correctly with Mongoose which took a lot longer than expected.
  * Learning and working with Materialize as CSS framework
  * Working with React.js and MERN as this was a first project for our team incorporating React, Mongo, Express, Node together.

  ## Future Development
  * Change user authentication from passport to AWS 
  * Add ability for user to create a card on home page out of a saved note
