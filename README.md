  ## Challenges
  * We had to work through 401 errors from Passport when trying to authenticate the user email and password.  We had used code from a previous project that was using Sequelize instead of Mongoose with Passport.  We needed to go through code and make sure everything was set up to work correctly with Mongoose which took a lot longer than expected.

  ## Future Development
  * Add a custom google search bar for users to search google directly through our site for documents and resources
  * Turn web page into a PWA so that it is accesible offline
  * Add a blog
  * Add ability for user to create a card on home page out of a saved note
