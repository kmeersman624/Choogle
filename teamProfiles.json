    "content": "Originally raised in Miami by artists, not able to escape the heat, driven to Arizona. Growing up surrounded by the pop art in Miami I have developed a deep passion for style, however, I construct my art via code. To connect my passion of creating a more beautiful world via design I have completed the Full-Stack development course via the University of Arizona. I am confidently able to create and coordinate dynamic user experiences via front end and back languages like, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, and React.js. Todayâ€™s trends go mobile first, so a cohesive and responsive design is always on my mind. I am known for collaborating, working hard and getting things done. Every project is unique and I will craft your site for the target audience.",
